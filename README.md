# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning model using Inception v3 and LSTM on the MS COCO dataset to generate
contextually relevant captions from images.
It uses pre-trained CNN model to extract visiual features in the image and LSTM to process these features to generate coherent and
descriptive captions, enabling the creation of rich, context-aware narratives for each image.
